      Fourth Industrial Revolution is building on the Third, the digital revolution that has been occurring since the middle of the last century. It is characterized by a fusion of technologies that is blurring the lines between the physical, digital, and biological spheres. The speed of current breakthroughs has no historical precedent. When compared with previous industrial revolutions, the Fourth is evolving at an exponential rather than a linear pace. Moreover, it is disrupting almost every industry in every country. And the breadth and depth of these changes herald the transformation of entire systems of production, management, and governance. <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-what-it-means-and-how-to-respond/" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="World Economic Forum"><i aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-external-link externalLink"></i></a>

It is also analyzed to be later targeted. But it doesnâ€™t stop there. The digital models of our behaviour can also tell what to do in order to manipulate and re-shape our behavior in the way that would be beneficial for those who create the model. Hence the power of vast amount of metadata.
