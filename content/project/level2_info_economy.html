  We have entered an economy in which knowledge and information is the primary raw material and source of value. It is being enabled by convergence of communication and data processing technologies into information technology (IT). Information economy is characterised by pervasive influence of IT on economic activity and every aspect of cultural, political, and social life which is based on the production and distribution of information. In such economy the most workers are information workers and most products are information products.  In a longer run that naturally divides society into new classes: those who are information-rich and those who are information-poor.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_economy" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top"><i aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-external-link externalLink"></i></a>
