  As we have established, within this increasingly automated world, there is an emerging logic of value production. Information is first being generated by people and is eventually collected and processed by machines where value is being generated (information still playing key role in supporting functionality of artificial intelligence or development of new products, for example). As this trend strengthens, we have more and more value being generated and accumulated at the later stages of production chain, leaving real producers with less opportunities to profit from their contribution.

<div>In other words, if this intelligence is provided by the people for free, the raw material required to develop and run this artificial intelligent system won’t be part of the economy anymore. And, the more the information or the information providers are treated as a consequence and not the core value, the more the economy will shrink as this automated system continues to advance; resulting in a much larger macroeconomic problem<a href="http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/macroeconomics.html" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top"><i aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-external-link externalLink"></i></a>.

<div>Besides, not only will the economy shrink, it will also be concentrated around those who have the best computing power to process, analyse and benefit from the information gathered.  </div>

<div>Let’s compare two companies to understand this phenomenon better. As Ian Leslie writes, “Kodak was founded in 1880, and at its peak employed nearly 145,300 people, including the ones employed indirectly via suppliers and retailers. The Eastmans, who founded Kodak, became wealthy while providing and even creating skilled jobs for several generations of middle-class Americans. Instagram was founded in 2010 as a free service and soon enough it disrupted Kodak, wiping out jobs for thousands of middle class workers. In 2012, Facebook bought Instagram, a company less than two years old, for a billion dollars. Even more remarkably, at the time of the sale, Instagram had exactly 13 employees.”<a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2014/01/kodak-vs-instagram-why-its-only-going-get-harder-make-good-living" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top"><i aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-external-link externalLink"></i></a>How could a billion-dollar company have only 13 employees? Was this because those employees were so extraordinarily valuable? No, it’s because much of its value came from the millions of users (now jobless) who contributed to the network without being paid for it. This is only a tiny snapshot of a concentrated wealth distribution eroding the middle class. If continued along this path, it only creates an unsustainable market economy.
