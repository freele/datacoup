    .descDiv With the technological progress and automation of human labor, we are transitioning to information economy, where information becomes the main raw material for economic growth, and production of information becomes the new nature of work. Failing to recognize that every bit of data we produce online is contributing to the larger system and claim ownership of it, allows others to do so. Large amounts of data collected and agglomerated by big tech companies lead to monopolization of information markets. This tendency, when coupled with further development of Internet of Things and wearable gadgets that allow to collect larger amounts of even more valuable data, results in unsustainable wealth distribution that ultimately leads to erosion of the middle class and market society. Project Data Coup is aimed at raising awareness about the fact that default way we treat information, if unchallenged, can lead to serious societal-level implications; and offers possible solution to the problem. With the core belief that

Powered by blockchain protocol, the ecosystem relies on Augmented Reality devices as a key medium. For users it allows to collect and sell their data to interested or approved parties. For companies it provides an opportunity to interact with users directly, by augmenting reality around them with contextually placed digital content. As a result, city becomes a fundamental component of the system, providing a stage for the whole new type of interactions.
