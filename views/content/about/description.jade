div With the technological progress and automation of human labor, we are transitioning to information economy, where information becomes the main raw material for economic growth, and production of information becomes the new nature of work. Failing to recognize that every bit of data we produce online is contributing to the larger system and claim ownership of it, allows others to do so. Large amounts of data collected and agglomerated by big tech companies lead to monopolization of information markets. This tendency, when coupled with further development of Internet of Things and wearable gadgets that allow to collect larger amounts of even more valuable data, results in unsustainable wealth distribution that ultimately leads to erosion of the middle class and market society. 

div Project Data Coup is aimed at raising awareness about the fact that default way we treat information, if unchallenged, can lead to serious societal-level implications; and offers possible solution to the problem. With the core belief that information has to be treated as an open commodity, the project envisions an ecosystem that allows everyone who is interested in accessing people’s generated data, to do so directly without having to go through the third party; and for people, on other hand, to benefit from the data they produce while exercising control – what information they are willing to share, whom they share it with, and how much they get paid for it. Powered by blockchain protocol, the ecosystem relies on Augmented Reality devices as a key medium. For users it allows to collect and sell their data to interested or approved parties. For companies it provides an opportunity to interact with users directly, by augmenting reality around them with contextually placed digital content. As a result, city becomes a fundamental component of the system, providing a stage for the whole new type of interactions.

div Project Data Coup has been conceived and developed as part of the Hybrid Urbanism Program at Strelka Institute [external link] in Moscow in 2016.
