  | It’s pretty easy. If only a few companies owned the precious data and metadata (as we have established, these are the foundation of  the information economy), they would not only become the wealthiest and most powerful companies (e.g. Alphabet). Being the only ones able to access the raw material, they also become the only ones that can develop the possible usages of the data. One could compare it with a situation in which there are no public libraries, but all companies and institutions have their own secluded knowledge base – it would obviously limit the amount of people able to use the information and, thus, strongly hold the development back. Now we have a case in which few companies have accumulated the main bulk of information, so it is centralized and can be well analyzed. However, since the database is not open to everyone, it is only used for the purposes benefitting these companies. It makes it impossible for others to use the information in more creative ways and prevents a competitive market from emerging. Right now a handful of companies dictate what needs to be and what should be developed, how it is developed and who it benefits.
